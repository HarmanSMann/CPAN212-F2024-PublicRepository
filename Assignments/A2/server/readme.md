I need you to do these tasks:

- create an express server
- connect your mongoDB account
- create a recipe model
- create a router file for recipe

- Handle these operations:
    - create new recipes
    - read recipes
    - read a single detailed recipe
    - edit a recipe
    - delete a recipe


I will talk to you all about this part:
- Also do some minor file uploads with multer
    - Upload a picture of the completed product so you know what it is
    - display the image on the frontend
