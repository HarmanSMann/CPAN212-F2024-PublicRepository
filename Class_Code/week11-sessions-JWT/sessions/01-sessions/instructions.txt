We are going to break this down into 2 mini lessons
The idea here is to showcase the 2 ways of handling user persistance

Based on my history of using them:

Sessions are fine, if you are looking to make a SSR application, this may be prefered
    Sessions store a piece of data, like a log, indicating all the visitors of the website and keep a notice of when they come in.
    We have to consider storing our information somewhere, and the server has its limits, so we will move it onto our database using mongoDB

    We will use express-session and connect-mongo for class purposes. Please check the npm store for more information


JWT (JSON Web Token), its a small ID card that you hand over to the user for them to access websites.
