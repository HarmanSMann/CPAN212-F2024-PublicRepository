Heres the thing about a JWT
It isnt something we store on the server or a DB, it is something the server will generate and send to the client side app
It will be something that we need to handle on both the client side and server side

Steps of creation:
Generate a Token:
    1 - When they login, generate a Token
    2 - send the token to the front end
    3 - client: app saves the token in local storage
