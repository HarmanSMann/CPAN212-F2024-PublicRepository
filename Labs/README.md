This directory will contin all of our lab solutions. 

Currently:
Lab 1
    P1 - node modules
        lab01p1.js
    P2 - Bookstore


To run these files:
1 - install the dependencies from the package.json
1.1 - in a terminal directed to the main directory of this project: npm install or npm i. This will locate the package.json and install anything under the dependancies

2 - move into the directory for whichever application you want to run and run it with: node filename.extension
2.1 - Example
        I want to run lab01p1.js
        I move into the directory that contains the file: cd part01
        Run the file with: "node lab01p1.js"
