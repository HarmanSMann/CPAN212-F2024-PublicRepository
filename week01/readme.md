Welcome to week 1 everyone. 

This folder will contain some of the basics from your previous class. I know you all had a summer break so you might be rusty. Try writing out some files and getting your hands warmed up.

- this does include files like:
    - HelloWorld (the first file most of us ever make)
    - modules (essentially code on a file we plan to reuse, a modular component we can use throughout our applications)
    - We make an example in class: files 06
    - callbacks (From your days in React)
    - a tiny, incomplete server, which we will continue in next class (there is a screenshot of a completed server file in the slides)
